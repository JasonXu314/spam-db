  <!--Roger Fritz lives on the lake's west side. He said in a tweet that he=
 saw one person swim to the south shore and one to the north. Another perso=
n was rescued by someone in a kayak, he said.       "My guess is the water =
is about 40 degrees," Fritz tweeted. Emergency scanners mentioned patients =
with hypothermia.       Scott Grummer, a fisheries biologist with the Iowa =
Department of Natural Resources said the water temperature was 39 to 42 deg=
rees near the shore.       The air temperature at 8:30 a.m. at the Ames Mun=
icipal Airport was 37 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. T=
he wind chill was 27 degrees, and the winds were blowing out of the northwe=
st at 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph, the NWS said.       The lake was stil=
l frozen over about two weeks ago, Fritz said in a Facebook Live video stre=
am.       Sheriff Timmons said "the lake was pretty rough."
      "I?m guessing they probably got swamped in some heavier waves," Fritz=
 said. "Those crew boats are really shallow."--->=20
