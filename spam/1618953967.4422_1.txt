  <!-- Don?t skip postpartum appointments
      The birth of a baby brings on strong emotions in normal times, but now feelings can be magnified. Following up with your obstetrical provider is very important, especially given the increased risk for postpartum depression. Your doctor should also check to make sure you are healing well from delivery, guide you in lifting any restrictions as time progresses postpartum and discuss contraceptive options and family planning.       For additional pregnancy and new parent tips, check out this helpful toolkit from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).       Tips For Friends and Family
      Even if you?re practicing social distancing, you can still stay connected and receive help from family and friends?whether near or far. Chances are they are biting at the bit to help too! If those in your life are asking for ways to help, don?t just brush them off. Here are six ways they can support you and your bundle of joy.       1. Set up a meal train or purchase gift cards
      Meal train deliveries are another option that have been around for a while. You can set-up and have people sign up to drop off meals (taking the necessary safety precautions) or have a meal delivery service drop something off at their door. ?The meal deliveries were so helpful while we were settling in at home and learning how to take care of the baby,? Beuthin said.       Another way to provide support is giving the new mom and parents gift cards. Whether it?s Walmart or Amazon, you can provide support for meals and any other financial expenses associated with being a new parent.--->
