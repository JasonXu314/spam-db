** Keep your Drink Hot Without the Microwave- The Homestyle Mug Warmer **
------------------------------------------------------------


This mug warmer is great to have on hand to heat up a variety of hot beverages and soups.  It keeps your beverages at the most suitable temperature.  The warming pad is activated by a pressure-based switch, so it's powered when your mug is on the device.  Additionally, the mug warmer is waterproof, so removing spillage and its stain is one wipe away.

under the weight of convictions and warrants. These perpetual punishments e=
