<!--Myth #5: Once I get the COVID-19 vaccine, I don?t need to wear a mask or social distance. Fact: It is important to continue masking and social distancing after you?ve received the COVID-19 vaccine, until public health experts recommend the easing of those practices. The COVID-19 vaccines were granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for their ability to prevent illness and death, but it?s not clear if they?ll also protect against asymptomatic infection and spread. Studies to determine this are ongoing. With that in mind, even if you get the vaccine, you should continue to mask around others, wash your hands and practice social distancing. These behaviors are very important to protect those around you until we have the majority of Americans vaccinated. Myth #6: We don?t know what?s in these vaccines. The vaccine could change my DNA or I could be tracked without even knowing!
Fact:  Despite what you?ve read or heard on social media, not only do we know exactly what?s in the COVID-19 vaccines, but we also know that they won?t change our genetic makeup and don?t contain any form of tracking device. ?Both vaccines rely on mRNA (messenger RNA) that tells our cells to make a portion of the viral spike protein which is the portion of the virus used to infect our cells,? Dr. O?Connor said. ?This triggers an immune response to the viral spike protein thus offering protection when exposed to the SARs-CoV2 virus. The vaccine?s mRNA does not last long in our bodies and can?t be incorporated in our DNA.?
The vaccines aren?t DNA-based vaccines. They?re mRNA-based vaccines, which means they don?t enter our DNA and can?t modify our DNA. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have published the ingredient lists. The vaccines don?t include location-tracking devices, so any statements suggesting otherwise are fictional.--->
