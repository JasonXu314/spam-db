** 3-in-1 Portable Air Cooler **
----------------------------------

Create your own personal microclimate!

This 3-in-1 evaporative air cooler cools, humidifies, and purifies the air around you.  Ideal for nightstands, desktops, camping tents, or dorm rooms.   In the summer months, the inside temperature of your home can be too much to bear.  With the sun beaming in and no respite in sight, it's all too easy to decide to front up a ton of money to install air conditioning.  However, who can afford the sky high electric bills that go with it? Instead of shelling out a fortune for an appliance you can neither afford nor need at every time of the year, it might be time to look for something a little less invasive.  This CoolAir device could be the answer!

Frost said he also wanted to prevent the police from shooting Khan. ?I didn?t want him to be shot because his statement made me believe that he wanted to die. And I had seen the chaos he had caused in the hall. And I didn?t want him to have the satisfaction of his choice when he took away others?.?

Frost said he eventually got off Khan when he had doubts about the suicide vest. ?I had a moment of hesitation thinking that maybe the bomb is fake. And maybe I should let go ? I thought I was risking getting shot in the head.? Moments later Khan was shot dead by the police. 
The coroner, Mark Lucraft QC, thanked Frost for what he called his ?amazing bravery?. 
Crilly, in a statement to the police read to the inquest, described seeing Khan standing with two large knives, shouting and jumping about. ?He was going nuts, he was shouting Allahu Akbar,? he said.--->

           <p class="css-1yqigsj"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Darryn Frost, a civil servant, poked the tusk into Khan's stomach after he had stabbed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, at a prisoner rehabilitation event in the hall on 29 November 2019.</span></p> 
           <p id="sign-in-gate"><span style="color: #ffffff;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
           <p class="css-1yqigsj"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Giving evidence at an inquest into their deaths, Frost described the subsequent standoff with Khan. He said: ?He still held the knives above him, but he glanced down at the narwhal tusk, and he glanced back up at me, and he kind of paused for a while. He seemed puzzled or a bit defeated by having this long object pointed at his belly.?</span></p>

I'm here for the police,'? Frost recalled. ?The attacker motioned downwards with his head and he said ?I've got a bomb'. I could see what looked like an explosive device around his waist.?</span></p> 
           <p class="css-1yqigsj"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Moments later Steve Gallant, a prisoner on day release, threw a heavy mahogany chair at Khan, Frost said. Still holding the tusk to Khan's stomach, Frost then passed the makeshift weapon to Gallant.</span></p> 
           <p class="css-1yqigsj"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Frost went to fetch a second tusk while Gallant used the first tusk to ?whack? Khan until it broke into pieces, the inquest was told.</span></p> 
           <p class="css-1yqigsj"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Later, Khan was chased out of the building and towards London Bridge by Frost, Gallant and John Crilly, a former prisoner who had been helped by Learning Together, the organisation hosting the event.</span></p> 
           <p class="css-1yqigsj"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Khan stumbled and fell after Frost hit him with the second tusk, and Crilly sprayed him with a fire extinguisher, the inquest heard. Crilly then hit Khan in the head and hand with the extinguisher and managed to take one of the knives from him, the inquest jury was told.</span></p> 
           <p class="css-1yqigsj"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Frost said he tried to pin down Khan by lying on top of him and tried to prevent his hands from reaching the vest.</span></p>
