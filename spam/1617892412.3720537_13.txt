Archana is now educated and returns to Mumbai after a year to visit her family and to attend her sister, Vaishali's wedding with Dharmesh Jaipurwala (who later cheats on her, but still remains married to her). Shravani has delivered a boy, too named as Sachin. Sulochana decides to get Archana married to Jaiwant, who only wants a working wife like Archana and wants to take over Dharmesh and Satish's company. He frames Manav in a false case creating rift between both families. Coincidentally, Manav and Shravani's marriage falls on the same date of Jaiwant and Archana's wedding. At the last moment, Manav and Archana realise that they deserve each other and run away from their respective mandalas. They marry each other and hence unite again. But Savita and Sulochana decline to accept them.
