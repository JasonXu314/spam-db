** THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY TOOLS YOU CAN FIT IN YOUR TOOLBAG.  THAT'S WHY WE PUT 3-IN-1.  **
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tape measure includes three different measuring tools so you'll always get an accurate measurement no matter the object.  A rolling tool great for curved surfaces and irregular objects, a flex cord for measuring around objects, and a laser tool for long measurements and hard to reach areas.  On top of that all measurements are precise to 1/100 of an inch.

?The entire biotech industry pivoted to focus on COVID-19 and the pandemic,=
? Dr. O'Connor said. ?Advancements in genetics, existing mRNA technology, u=

olor: #ffffff;">In other vaccine and drug developments, it can take months =
and months to gather a small cohort of participants for clinical trials. Fo=
r the COVID-19 vaccine, tens of thousands lined up quickly to enroll in the=
 randomized trials. The FDA, as well as an independent panel of vaccine exp=
erts, closely scrutinized the data for the trials to ensure the vaccines we=

 that's not just in the U.S. Similar panels in other countries have done th=
