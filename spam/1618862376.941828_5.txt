&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=3D"color: #ffffff;">3. Accept Your Emotions ?The =
reality is that the feelings we?re experiencing in response to what?s happe=
ning right now aren?t unilaterally positive. We don?t want to get stuck the=
re, but we?re overcompensating by painting sunshine if we aren?t first just=
 accepting how we feel,? Dr. Goto said. ?Hard times are hard, and the more =
we try to talk ourselves out of the way we feel, the more anxiety and depre=
ssion will increase.? Being positive all the time just isn?t realistic. Be =
fair to yourself and to others and allow yourself to grieve. ?At work, I th=
ought I was being a supportive coworker and co-mom before the pandemic. Whi=
le I listened to their concerns, I always felt this sense of separation?thi=
s me versus them,? Dr. Adelayo said. ?Now I don?t ask how they are doing. I=
 know they aren?t okay. I validate and share in their struggles. The layer =
of support and understanding is deeper when we are truly authentic and hone=
st with how we are feeling with one another. We?ve become a more supportive=
 and united team.? 4. Ask for What You Need and Accept Help Your expectatio=
ns of yourself are so high, you hold other people to those same expectation=
s. And, as a result, you probably just do it yourself. But now working moms=
 are paying the price for doing it all?big time. It?s time to ask for help?=
and most importantly, accept it when it?s offered. Accepting help is not a =
sign of weakness, but refusing it might be. ?The truth is that we probably =
have supportive members of our family and social networks who are willing t=
o help if we just allowed ourselves to accept their best efforts for what t=
hey are,? Dr. Goto said. ?Yet letting go a smidge of control and accepting =
help for just what it is, help, can relieve some of that stress we?re feeli=
ng.? 5. Self-Care: Take Time for You Right now, you?re trying to keep every=
thing and everyone together, but who helps mom? Who?s tending to your basic=
 needs (i.e., getting sleep, eating right, drinking plenty of water)? All m=
oms can agree these go out the window when family calls. It?s time to make =
space for you and your self-care. Doing so helps your mind and body thrive.=
 You?ll notice you are less anxious, more focused and present..</span> </p>=
